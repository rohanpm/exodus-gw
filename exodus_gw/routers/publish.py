"""APIs for publishing blobs.

In the context of exodus-gw, "publishing" a blob means exposing it
via one or more user-accessible paths on the CDN. These blobs should first
be uploaded using the [upload](#tag/upload) APIs.


## Atomicity

exodus-gw aims to enable atomic semantics for publishes; i.e., for a set
of published content, committing the publish will make either *all* of it
available (if commit succeeds) or *none* of it available (if commit fails),
with no partial updates becoming visible from the point of view of a CDN
client.

In practice, limitations in the storage backend mean that true atomicity
is not achieved for all but the smallest publishes, so it is more accurate
to refer to the commit operation as "near-atomic".

Here are a few of the strategies used by exodus-gw in order to achieve as
close as possible to atomic behavior:

- exodus-gw performs writes to the underlying database (DynamoDB) in batches,
  which themselves are committed atomically.

  - (True atomicity could be achieved if the entire publish fits within
     a single batch, but as batches have a maximum size of 25 items, this
     is rarely the case.)

- All operations are aggressively retried in case of error.

- exodus-gw keeps track of what has been committed and is able to roll
  back a partially committed publish in case of unrecoverable errors.

- During commit, the items to be committed are prioritized intelligently
  with knowledge of the types of content being published. Files which serve
  as an index or entry point to a set of content are committed last, to ensure
  minimal impact in the case that a commit is interrupted.
  See "two-phase commit" below for a more in-depth explanation of this.

It should be noted that the atomicity discussed here applies only to the interaction
between exodus-gw and its underlying data store. exodus-gw does not contain any CDN
cache purging logic; the impact of CDN caching must also be considered when evaluating
the semantics of a publish from the CDN client's point of view.

## Two-phase commit

All published content is categorized into two phases, phase 1 and phase 2,
and committed in that order. exodus-gw performs this categorization internally
and clients cannot influence this.

Simple clients do not need to worry about this, but in more complicated scenarios
the client may wish to control the commit of each phase independently. In such
cases it is important to understand how the two phases are intended to work.

Phase 1 content:

- includes the majority of content within a publish
- should be immutable
- is usually not discoverable by CDN users without consulting some form of index
- examples: RPM files within a yum repo; any generic file

Phase 2 content:

- includes a small minority of content within a publish
- is usually mutable, perhaps changing at every publish
- contains indexes, repository entry points or other references pointing at
  phase 1 content (and thus must be committed last)
- examples: `repodata/repomd.xml` within a yum repo; `PULP_MANIFEST` within a
  Pulp file repository

As an example of this phased approach, consider the publish of a yum repository.
A client consuming packages from a yum repository discovers available packages
via a series of fetches involving multiple files which are published together,
e.g.

`repodata/repomd.xml` => `repodata/<checksum>-primary.xml.gz`
  => `Packages/<somepackage>.rpm`

If no ordering were to be applied to the publish of these files it would be
possible for `repomd.xml` to be published prior to `<checksum>-primary.xml.gz`,
or for `<checksum>-primary.xml.gz` to be published prior to
`Packages/<somepackage>.rpm`, either of which could cause a CDN consumer to
attempt to fetch content which has not yet been published, resulting in 404
errors.

This problem is avoided by exodus-gw internally categorizing `repomd.xml` as
phase 2 content and ensuring it is committed only after the rest of the files
in the repo, which are categorized as phase 1 content.

## Expiry of publish objects

Publish objects should be treated as ephemeral; they are not persisted indefinitely.

- All publish objects which have reached a terminal state (failed or committed) will be
  deleted after some server-defined timeout, defaulting to two weeks.
- Publish objects which have been created but not committed within a server-defined timeout,
  typically one day, will be marked as failed.


## Expiry of task objects

Like publish objects, task objects created when publishes are committed are not persisted
indefinitely.

- All task objects which have reached a terminal state (failed or complete) will be
  deleted after some server-defined timeout, defaulting to two weeks.
- Task objects not picked up by a worker within a server-defined time limit, defaulting
  to two hours, will be marked as failed along with the associated publish object. This
  prevents system overload in the event of a worker outage.

    Committing a publish is required in order to expose published content from the CDN.

    There are two available commit modes, "phase1" and "phase2" (default).

    ### Phase 1

    A phase 1 commit:

    - is optional.
    - can be performed more than once.
    - does not prevent further modifications to the publish.
    - will commit all phase 1 content (e.g. packages in yum repos), but not phase 2
      content (e.g. repodata in yum repos); see
      [Two-phase commit](#section/Two-phase-commit).
    - is not rolled back if a later phase 2 commit fails (or never occurs).

    ### Phase 2

    A phase 2 commit:

    - is the default when no commit mode is specified.
    - can (and should) be performed exactly once.
    - freezes the associated publish object - no further items can be added.
    - will commit all content with near-atomic behavior; see
      [Atomicity](#section/Atomicity).

    ### Notes

    Commit occurs asynchronously.  This API returns a Task object which may be used
    to monitor the progress of the commit.

    Note that exodus-gw does not require that any given path is only modified by
    a single publish. If multiple publish objects updating the same path are being
    committed at the same time, after both commits succeed, the path will point
    at whichever item was updated most recently.
